# REST-API-with-FastAPI
 Practice constructing REST API and understanding fundamentals.

 This API will help me better understand how those work together with other apps to add,use and remove data from a connected database.

 This API is a basic database research app that will be able to research, add, remove and modify users from the json database I created. With the knowledge I will get from making this API I will have the skills to tackle more complex projects and maybe in the future be able to hack API's as assessments.
